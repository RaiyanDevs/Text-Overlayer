# Text Overlayer
This is a program that was originally written in Python, and was then converted to a .exe file through the program Auto Py To Exe. It runs in the Windows terminal.

It takes a path input leading to a video and then overlays text of your choice on top of the video. It then saves the video to another user specified path.

Do note that the program struggles with larger videos. It also can take a while to start up in the terminal, do not worry and just let it do its thing.
